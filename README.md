# Computer Vision RPS
This project implements a Rock-Paper-Scissors game that uses a webcam to capture the user's hand gesture and a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the computer's choice. The aim of the project is to provide an interactive and engaging experience for users to play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer.

## What it does
    Captures the user's hand gesture using a webcam.
    Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the computer's choice.
    Implements a countdown timer displayed on the webcam feed.
    Continues the game until either the computer or the user wins three rounds.
    Displays the winner of the game.
    
## Aim of the Project
The main goal of this project is to create a fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game that showcases the integration of computer vision and machine learning in a real-world application. It aims to provide an enjoyable user experience while demonstrating the capabilities of using a webcam and a machine learning model together in a Python application.

## What I Learned
    Integrating a webcam feed into a Python application using OpenCV.
    Using a pre-trained machine learning model in a Python application.
    Implementing interactive features such as countdown timers in a GUI application.
    Organizing code using object-oriented programming and classes in Python.

## Milestone 1 - Create the computer vision system
Creates the model which shows wether the user is throwing Rock, Paper or Scissors to the camera.

## Milestone 2 - Create the rock. paper, scissors game
Create a python script that will simulate a Rock, Paper, Scissor game, in which the code will ask for an input then compare the input with the computers choice to show the winner 

## Milestone 3 - Use the camera to play rock, paper, scissors game
